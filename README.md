# shrewdb

a tiny sql database for learning, this is done as part of an attempt to write a sql database in a couple of weekends - so there's not a lot much yet. See [toydb](https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb) which serves as an inspiration, but the distributed nature of it are non-goals.

also, this project is being written as I read through [Database Internals by Alex Petrov](https://www.databass.dev)


# roadmap
